PokerStars Bot (Discontinued) 🃏🤖

Developed by Marvin Müller


📖 About the Project

This project was developed in C# and uses the Tesseract library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to capture on-screen information. The software was intended to function as a bot for PokerStars, automating the process of reading game data. However, development was discontinued after realizing that the use of bots violates the platform's terms of service.
Despite that, this project is being made available for educational purposes and to showcase my development skills. It should not be used in online games or any platform where automation is prohibited.

Development of this project has been discontinued for ethical reasons and compliance with PokerStars' terms of service. There are no plans to continue this project, but it serves as a demonstration of my skills in:

OCR library integration.

Automation of repetitive tasks.

UI development in C#.


⚠️ Warning
